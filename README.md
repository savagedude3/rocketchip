# MeChIP2

## What is MeCHIP2?
MeCHIP2 is an automated bioinformatics pipeline that downloads raw paired-end sequence data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Sequence data is downloaded directly from the SRA using the SRA Toolkit (sra-tools, v2.10.9). The raw sequence read file is then split into its respective paired-end read filres by the SRA Toolkit.
